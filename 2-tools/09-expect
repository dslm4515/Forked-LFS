# Force Expect's configure script to use /bin/stty instead of 
# a /usr/local/bin/stty it may find on the host system. This 
# will ensure that our test suite tools remain sane for the 
# final builds of our toolchain:
cp -v configure{,.orig}
sed 's:/usr/local/bin:/bin:' configure.orig > configure

# Configure source
./configure --prefix=/tools       \
            --with-tcl=/tools/lib \
            --with-tclinclude=/tools/include

# Compile
make 

# Install without the supplementary Expect scripts, which are not needed
make SCRIPTS="" install
