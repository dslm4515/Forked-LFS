# At this point, it is imperative to stop and ensure that the basic functions (compiling and linking) of the new toolchain are working as expected. To perform a sanity check, run the following commands:

echo 'int main(){}' > dummy.c
$LFS_TGT-gcc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /tools'

# If everything is working correctly, there should be no errors, and the output of the last command will be of the form:
# [Requesting program interpreter: /tools/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]

# Once all is well, clean up the test files:
rm -v dummy.c a.out
