# Currently, the $LFS/tools directory is owned by the user lfs, 
# a user that exists only on the host system. If the $LFS/tools 
# directory is kept as is, the files are owned by a user ID 
# without a corresponding account. This is dangerous because a 
# user account created later could get this same user ID and 
# would own the $LFS/tools directory and all the files therein, 
# thus exposing these files to possible malicious manipulation.

# To avoid this issue, you could add the lfs user to the new 
# LFS system later when creating the /etc/passwd file, taking 
# care to assign it the same user and group IDs as on the 
# host system. Better yet, change the ownership of the 
# $LFS/tools directory to user root by running the following 
# command:
chown -R root:root $LFS/tools

# Although the $LFS/tools directory can be deleted once the 
# LFS system has been finished, it can be retained to build 
# additional LFS systems of the same book version. How best 
# to backup $LFS/tools is a matter of personal preference.
