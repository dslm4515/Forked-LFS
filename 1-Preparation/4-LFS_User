# When logged in as user root, making a single mistake can 
# damage or destroy a system. Therefore, we recommend 
# building the packages in this chapter as an unprivileged 
# user. You could use your own user name, but to make it 
# easier to set up a clean working environment, create a 
# new user called lfs as a member of a new group (also 
# named lfs) and use this user during the installation 
# process. As root, issue the following commands to add 
# the new user:
groupadd lfs
useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs

# To log in as lfs (as opposed to switching to user lfs 
# when logged in as root, which does not require the lfs 
# user to have a password), give lfs a password:
passwd lfs

# Grant lfs full access to $LFS/tools by making lfs the 
# directory owner:
chown -v lfs $LFS/tools

# If a separate working directory was created as 
# suggested, give user lfs ownership of this directory:
chown -v lfs $LFS/sources

# Next, login as user lfs. This can be done via a 
# virtual console, through a display manager, or with 
# the following substitute user command:
su - lfs

# The “-” instructs su to start a login shell as opposed 
# to a non-login shell. The difference between these two 
# types of shells can be found in detail in bash(1) and 
# info bash.
