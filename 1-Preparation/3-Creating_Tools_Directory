# All programs compiled in Stage 2 will be installed under 
# $LFS/tools to keep them separate from the programs 
# compiled in Stage 3. The programs compiled here are 
# temporary tools and will not be a part of the final LFS 
# system. By keeping these programs in a separate directory, 
# they can easily be discarded later after their use. This 
# also prevents these programs from ending up in the host 
# production directories (easy to do by accident in Stage 2).

# Create the required directory by running the following as root:
mkdir -v $LFS/tools

# The next step is to create a /tools symlink on the host 
# system. This will point to the newly-created directory on 
# the LFS partition. Run this command as root as well:
ln -sv $LFS/tools /

# NOTE -- The above command is correct. The ln command has a 
# few syntactic variations, so be sure to check info coreutils 
# ln and ln(1) before reporting what you may think is an error.

# The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so 
# that it always refers to /tools, meaning that the compiler, 
# assembler, and linker will work both in Chapter 5 (when we 
# are still using some tools from the host) and in the next 
# (when we are “chrooted” to the LFS partition).
