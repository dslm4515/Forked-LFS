# There is a list of packages that need to be downloaded in order 
# to build a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers 
# correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, 
# and this repo is based on their use. We highly recommend against 
# using newer versions because the build commands for one version 
# may not work with a newer version. The newest package versions 
# may also have problems that require work-arounds.

# Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download 
# location has changed since this book was published, Google 
# (http://www.google.com/) provides a useful search engine for 
# most packages. If this search is unsuccessful, try one of the 
# alternative means of downloading discussed at 
# http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html#packages.

# Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored 
# somewhere that is conveniently available throughout the entire 
# build. A working directory is also required to unpack the 
# sources and build them. $LFS/sources can be used both as the 
# place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working 
# directory. By using this directory, the required elements 
# will be located on the LFS partition and will be available 
# during all stages of the building process.

# To create this directory, execute the following command, as 
# user root, before starting the download session:
mkdir -v $LFS/sources

# Make this directory writable and sticky. “Sticky” means 
# that even if multiple users have write permission on a 
# directory, only the owner of a file can delete the file 
# within a sticky directory. The following command will 
# enable the write and sticky modes:
chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources

# An easy way to download all of the packages and patches is 
# by using wget-list (provided in this repo) as an input to 
# wget. For example:
wget --input-file=wget-list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources

# There is a separate file, md5sums, which can be used to 
# verify that all the correct packages are available before 
# proceeding. Place that file in $LFS/sources and run:
pushd $LFS/sources
md5sum -c md5sums
popd
