# Kernel Headers

# Make sure there are no stale files and dependencies 
# lying around from previous activity:
make mrproper

# Extract the user-visible kernel headers from the source:
make headers

# Install headers
cp -rv usr/include/* /usr/include

# After installed, there still are also some hidden
# files used by the kernel developers (for what?)
# and not needed by MLFS that now can be removed
# from our /usr/include.
find /usr/include -name '.*' -exec rm -vf {} \;

# The Makefile present also won't be used
rm -v /usr/include/Makefile
