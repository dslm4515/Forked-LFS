# Meson is not strictly required for this LFS 
# build as it doen not use systemd. On the 
# other hand, meson/ninja is a powerful build 
# system, which is expected to be used more 
# and more often. It is required for several 
# packages in the BLFS book.

# Compile
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD

# Install
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist meson
