# Disable the installation of the groups program and its man pages, as Coreutils provides a better version. Also, prevent the installation of manual pages that were already installed:
sed -i 's/groups$(EXEEXT) //' src/Makefile.in
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/groups\.1 / /'   {} \;
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/getspnam\.3 / /' {} \;
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/passwd\.5 / /'   {} \;

# Instead of using the default crypt method, use the more secure SHA-512 method of password encryption, which also allows passwords longer than 8 characters. It is also necessary to change the obsolete /var/spool/mail location for user mailboxes that Shadow uses by default to the /var/mail location used currently. And, get rid of /bin and /sbin from PATH, since they are simply symlinks to their counterpart in /usr.

sed -e 's:#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES:ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512:' \
    -e 's:/var/spool/mail:/var/mail:'                 \
    -e '/PATH=/{s@/sbin:@@;s@/bin:@@}'                \

# Compile
make

# Install it:
make exec_prefix=/usr install
make -C man install-man

# Configuratin of postinstall:
# To enable shadowed passwords, run the following command:
pwconv

# To enable shadowed group passwords, run:
grpconv

# Optionally, to change defaults:
mkdir -p /etc/default
useradd -D --gid 999

# If you would prefer that these mailbox files are not created by useradd, issue the following command:
sed -i '/MAIL/s/yes/no/' /etc/default/useradd
