# Preparing Virtual Kernel File Systems

# Make sure $LFS is set
echo $LFS

# Create directories onto which the file systems will 
# be mounted:
mkdir -pv $LFS/{dev,proc,sys,run}

# Create initial device nodes:
mknod -m 600 $LFS/dev/console c 5 1
mknod -m 666 $LFS/dev/null c 1 3

# Since this new system does not yet have Udev and has 
# not yet been booted, it is necessary to mount and 
# populate /dev manually. This is accomplished by bind 
# mounting the host system's /dev directory. Use the 
# following command to achieve this:
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev

# Mount the remaining virtual kernel filesystems:
mount -vt devpts devpts $LFS/dev/pts -o gid=5,mode=620
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs tmpfs $LFS/run

# In some host systems, /dev/shm is a symbolic link to 
# /run/shm. The /run tmpfs was mounted above so in this 
# case only a directory needs to be created:
if [ -h $LFS/dev/shm ]; then
  mkdir -pv $LFS/$(readlink $LFS/dev/shm)
fi

# As user root, run the following command to enter the 
# realm that is, at the moment, populated with only 
# the temporary tools:
chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root                  \
    TERM="$TERM"                \
    PS1='(lfs chroot) \u:\w\n\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \
    /tools/bin/bash --login +h
