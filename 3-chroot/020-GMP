# If you are building for 32-bit x86, but you have a CPU 
# which is capable of running 64-bit code and you have 
# specified CFLAGS in the environment, the configure 
# script will attempt to configure for 64-bits and fail. 
# Avoid this by invoking the configure command below with
ABI=32 ./configure ...

# The default settings of GMP produce libraries optimized 
# for the host processor. If libraries suitable for 
# processors less capable than the host's CPU are desired, 
# generic libraries can be created by running the following:
cp -v configfsf.guess config.guess
cp -v configfsf.sub   config.sub

# Configure the source:
./configure --prefix=/usr    \
            --enable-cxx     \
            --disable-static \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gmp-6.2.1

# Compile
make 
make html

# Test the results.
make check 2>&1 | tee gmp-check-log

# Ensure that all 197 tests in the test suite passed. 
# Check the results by issuing the following command:
awk '/# PASS:/{total+=$3} ; END{print total}' gmp-check-log

# Install it:
make install
make install-html
